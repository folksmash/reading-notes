* map()
Each list item needs a unique ____.
* Values

What is the purpose of a key?

What is the spread operator?
* it allows you to expand objects or strings into elements

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
* Copying an array
* Using Math functions
* Adding to state in React
* Converting NodeList to an array

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
* Math.min and math.max both return numbers within a range

Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
(example added from https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)
* const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
  const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
  console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
(example added from https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)
* const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂


In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
* you must create a function in the state you would like it operate in
