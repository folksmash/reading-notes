# Notes

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- it is an element that maintains it's own state and is updated with user input. 

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- we should wait until the form is submitted so the information is only updated once 


How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- event.target.name


Why would we use a ternary operator?

- some user input fields will have multiple outputs and this allows us to set end results for multiple types or amounts that are input by the user. 

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }

- condition ? 'x' === 'y' console.log(true) : console.log(false);
