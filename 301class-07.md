## What is functional programming?
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming -->
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data - Wikipedia 

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
it is a function that returns exactly what the argument requests

## What are the benefits of a pure function?
becase sometimes pulling parameters from outside of the function will cause it to result in unintended outputs 

## What is immutability?
unable to be changed

## What is Referential transparency?
it is when a function always provides the same output regardless of what parameters are provided 


## What is a module?
individual bits of code that do a single function

## What does the word ‘require’ do?
it brings a module into the current segment you are working in

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
importing it

## What do we have to do to make a module available?
you must export the module
