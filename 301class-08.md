# Notes

## What is a ‘call’?
it is the code used to cause a function to run
## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
only one
## What does LIFO mean?
last in, first out
## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
<!-- example from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/ -->
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
## What causes a Stack Overflow?
when a function without an end point calls itself it will cause a loop and jam up the other functions attemps to run


## What is a ‘refrence error’?
when you attempt to use a variable that isn't declared 
## What is a ‘syntax error’?
when you attempt to pass variables that do not work together
## What is a ‘range error’?
when you attempt to adjust something by an incorrect length value
## What is a ‘tyep error’?
when variables are undefinied 
## What is a breakpoint?
it will only run a function up to the point you want based on the breakpoint instead of the entire function
## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
it is something you do in the console. things like console.log() help find where functions are breaking and what parts are working
