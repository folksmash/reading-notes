# Notes

- Serverless computing takes a lot of the data management load off the consumer and relies more heavily on toolsuits like AWS or Google services
- This style of computing provides more dev time for front end work as the services manage most analytics 
- Some draw backs of this are the design limitations of the service you use based on your specific needs
- Serverless computing is best used for things like API backends, data processing, Map operations, and stream process workloads
