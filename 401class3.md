# Notes

- files are made of three parts
    * header: metadata
    * data: the contents
    * end of file: special handling info

- files contain paths and folders that contain subfiles 

- files can be opend with the open() command but require the file path inside the command
- different file types have different handlings for opening based on type

## Python Exceptions

- Errors are when syntax fails to function properly
- Exceptions are 'errors' made by design of a dev
- exceptions, like errors will end a program immediately
- you can also assert exceptions, this is when you do not run the entire code but stop at the specific section of a function that you've assigned an exception to
