# Notes

- Classes are used as a temple to store objects
- Objects are the sum of functions and variables for a single entity

- Recusrive functions repeat a set of defined steps over and over until a condition is met by the result
- this allows the loop to continue as many or as a few times as needed 
- Recursive functions are particularly good at factoring
- To maintain state during the rescursive calls you must have state in the global scope or thread the state back through with each pass 
- Lists would be considered a rescursive data structure
