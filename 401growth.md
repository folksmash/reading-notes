# The Growth Mindset


## Practice Makes Perfect

* Taking up deliberate practice to improve weak points
* Working outside of your day-to-day role to learn more
* Picking up coding challenges can help also

## Not Yet

* When attempting to learn things you have to be ready to fail
* Failure is a learning tool and not a punishment
* Being given a pathway to learn more difficult things will increase one's growth mindset 

## Grit 

* Intelligence isn't the only factor for learning
* Willingness to learn plays a big factor
* The effort must match the task depending on an individuals intelligence
* Grit helps people finish long term goals 

## Success 

* Success is achievemnet oriented for most
* You must determine your own success
* Believing in your own sucess helps progress 
* Envy is bred through closeness of humans 

## Emotional Intelligence

* I scored very low self-management and very high on social awareness. I have a really easy time interacting with people regardless of the situation but I handle time on my own very poorly. I typically combat this by having some form schedule or structure to what I plan to accomplish for the day 

## Bias

* I scored highly on the empathy and curiosity section but low for effective courage. I have made steps to increase my effective courage by being more positive and having a better outlook for large projects. I do not handle multiple steps of a process at once very well.
