# CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to adjust the style and look of a webpage
CSS is rule based and uses multiple layers of commands to adjust the format of your product. Things like the color of a background, size and shape of images, and even the apperance of links or buttons can be adjusted in CSS
Like the other languages we have previously viewed this one is started with a bracket system using curly braces {} 
Additonally, like other coding languages the processes are logical and contained within their own space. Spaces are defined by the curly brackets and what they apply to, for example if you were change the title you would want to make adjustments in the title level through your CSS page, then you could choose to change other font in a separate space to a different color, also another option would to be to loop both sections into the same brackets and apply the changes to both.
