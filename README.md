# Day 1 notes

Markdown is a text based display control that allows you to *simply* creat complicated web pages and then host them immediately through a site called [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Markdown makes it easy to stylize and organize the information you want to show the world online. It reminds me of some of the functionality of Myspace.

Some of the options offered include creating tables, emojis ðŸ˜Ž, or even spicing up your work with images! 
Most functions work in logical manner. making adjustments to text is done by defining around the text with an asterik or underscore to adjut the styling or size of the font. a single marking will cause the text to be italicized *like this* and a double mark with indicate a **bold section**. Additionally you can use the list function to order the information you wish to share
* lists 
* can be be without an order
1. or you can select
2. a numbered system to add the items in an order

Formatting doesn't end with just lists. you can add quotes 

Jordan remaked as the sun hit his eyes:
> so this is what before 11am looks like, hmmm.

The most important feature in a visual based program is to me are images! With Markdown's functionality and the ease of posting online anyone could run their own motivational website for new coders.
