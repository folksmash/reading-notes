## Hello
My name is Jordan Folk and I'm a student at Code Fellows in Seattle. Below is a continued project as I learn and explore coding. I have an adorable dog named Drax and I've been enjoying Seattle since 2019! ðŸ’»

To me growth mindset encompasses you look at things. Although what we are learning is a niche skillset and can be difficult to learn its important to remember it takes time. Although many people may have background info or be *ahead* of you there is no race to learning this information.

I want to remind myself through this course:
* you will make mistakes
* it wont always be easy
* and you will finish the program with the right mindset
