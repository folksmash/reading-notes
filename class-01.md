# Reading notes

## HTML Notes

* HTML contain plain text
* Pages can be sectioned into smaller sub sections with tags
* Tags are like folders that keep all the pages together that work together
* Tags include types like header or footer
* Headings and lists can be made with tags

## Extra Mark UP

* HTML4 (the most similar to today's standard) was created in 1997
* Comments can be added that are not shown on the user's end but can be read in the code for context
* Various elements can be used to adjust font size or position 
* Images and links can be added with elements also
* Some characters cause functions at the code level and must be 'escaped' to appear on the user's end. Codes or short phrases followed by a colon will cause those characters to appear on the web page like the less than sign &lt;

## HTML5 Layout

* HTML5 allows for more styling options without the use of DIV
* Header and Footer are given their own tag not an adjustment on the DIV tag like in HTML4
* Some older browser may struggle to read the language but JavaScript is available to solve the problem

## Process and Design

* Wireframe is a tool used to map out the look of your website without writing code
* The appearance and ease of use play a big factor in repeat usage
* You are able to decide which information is most visible and how users navigate your page
* Colors, font sizes, and images can be used to aid in the information flow

## The ABC's of Programming

* Programmers use specific vocabularies to form syntax that the computer follows directly
* JavaScript can be used in multiple ways and is able to perform more actions than HTML or CSS
* JS allows for loops with various responses
* Programmers are able to set scripts based on the input of the user
* JS is kept on it's own page when writing code and linked back into the HTML page with a script
* This allows for multiple functions or prompts to exist on one page without clutter and overlapping
