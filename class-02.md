## Text

* You can adjust text with HTML tags to edit the color, position, or 
size of the text
* Placing multiple spaces in the written code will help the programmer but still display the same contextual information in the same position
* Quotes and links can be inserted into text with appropriate tags

## Introducing CSS

* CSS has different language rules than HTML but works along side it
* CSS is heavily used for styling a page
* CSS pages can be inserted from another page or added inline with the HTMl code on the same page
* CSS can easily change the color of an entire page or just specific elements within the page
* CSS code is made of two parts, the element you'd like to change followed by the property provided to the element

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

* A script is a series of multiple commands listed to shape a webpage
* JavaScript does little thinking for you and requires direct input to get the ouput you desite
* JS uses variables to potentially change the flow of a script based on the inputs it receives 
* JS reads multiple types of inputs including numbers, typed words, and boolean logic values 
* JS can perform basic operations like arethmatic

## Decisions and Loops

* Decisions can be made by the code you put in place and are factored against the received inputs
* Loops are decisions that run in potentially unlimited attempts
* Processes are determined by a set of comparative conditions the code grades like the range of a number or which day of the week it is
* These processes can be tied together to provide outputs to the user based on their input
* numbers like 50 and words like Fifty do not equal out to each other in JS because one of them 50 (is an number) and fifty (is a word)
