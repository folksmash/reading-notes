## Images

* images are added with the IMG element
* images must be properly sourced to appear on the page 
* photographs work better as JPEG images 
* having images at the size you would like them on the website when sourcing the image can save a lot of problems

## Color

* color can be added via RBG, hex codes, and color names
* apps can help select a color with a visual prompt
* font and background colors shouldn't clash or reduce the text visibility
* RGBA and HSLA were added via css3 which allows for even more varied colors

## Text

* multiple aspects of the text can be adjusted like font size, position, and color
* you can change the type of font used
* spaces around the text can be adjusted to the container it is placed in
