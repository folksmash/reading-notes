## Domain Modeling

* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain  model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Tables

* tables are added with the < table > element
* rows in tables are added with 'tr'
* cells inside the table are represented by 'td'
* long tables can have a head, body, and foot added via elements

## Functions, methods, and objects

* Functions are groups of statements put together to do a single thing
* Functions turn parameters into values
* an object is multiple variables that work together
* Browsers use objects to place items on screen and do processes in the background
* JS has some pre built in functions
* Arrays and objects can be used together to make functions
