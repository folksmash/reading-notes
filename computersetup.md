Text editing tools are used to set up code for a program and can be used as a sandbox to work on projects in before publishing or running the project. Although most text editing programs are similiar there are a few things to look for that may help:
* code completion
* colored themes to rotate through
* syntax highlighting
* extensions available for usage in the tool

These features will assist you in completing finished codes. When hand drawing things in a way such as coding any form of guide will be helpful. Selecting the tool you are going to use has a major impact on your workspace and workflow.
