# text editors, how do they work?
Text editing tools are used to set up code for a program and can be used as a sandbox to work on projects in before publishing or running the project. Although most 
text editing programs are similiar there are a few things to look for that may help:
* code completion
* colored themes to rotate through
* syntax highlighting
* extensions available for usage in the tool
