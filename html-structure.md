# HTML Usages

HTML can be used for multiple reasons and functions that cover everything from behind the scenes processing to sections of the website that customers interact with like buttons and login screens.

Wireframing is used to help design the front facing section of the website. Wireframing is much more visual and utilizes an interfacing tool similar to Microsoft's Paint to help you establish your website's look. Wireframing is particularly useful for taking hand drawn ideas for interfaces and creating a representation in digital form.

A few options of tools to wireframe include UXpin, InVision, and Wireframe.cc
