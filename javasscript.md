## How computers work

Computers are the next step of tools used by humans. Similiar to previous tools, a computer is used to speed up a task with automation or assistance. Computers function more so to solve complicated problems or multiple problems at once that would be difficult for people. This can be extended out to functional moving items not just math problems.

Computers perform four primary functions
* take input
* store
* process
* output

When storing data computers function with binary and utilize 1's and 0's. These numbers work as open or closed circuits telling the computer which processes to run and how. Computers are considerably smaller now than they were originally and this has caused them to work at a faster rate. The data is moved at the speed of light and the distance it must travel to be processed is much smaller now.
