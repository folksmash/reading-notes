# Operators
JavaScript uses two types of operators
* binary
* unary
These types dictate the type of operator commands used

# Loops

These are actions that can be repeated multiple times based on a path defined by Javascript commands. Loops can be used for events like guessing a number or picking which day of the week it is. With the correct conditions you could repeat the question until it is answered properly according to the assigned values.
